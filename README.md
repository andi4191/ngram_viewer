    Google Ngram Viewer takes 3 ngrams:2 2-grams and 1 1-gram and gives a distribution of occurrences of those in English language books over 200 years.

    OR

    here's a very cool one: https://goo.gl/NmPrrt

    This project uses per-year directories with books in them from 2012 through 2016
  
    This project is a similar implementation of Google Ngram viewer which takes this data and exposes an
    ngram view run locally

    Support 1-grams through 5-grams.

    It accounts for spelling mistakes in the input ngram queries and also supports for key words (entities, nouns/verbs etc) in the input ngrams by using lemmatization and stemming
    
    To run the code:
    python main.py —data_dir task —inpiut_query ‘nationalist, italics are, the hotel’
    
    Suggestions are most welcome
    
    Thanks
